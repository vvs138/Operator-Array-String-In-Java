State the difference between StringBuffer and StringBuilder in java.
Ans-->

The main difference between `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder` in Java is that `StringBuffer` is thread-safe (synchronized), while `StringBuilder` is not. This means that if multiple threads are working with a `StringBuffer` object, access is synchronized to ensure data consistency. On the other hand, `StringBuilder` is faster in a single-threaded environment but is not suitable for concurrent operations due to its lack of synchronization.
